## Summary

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Notebooks Execute | PASS (with 1 path issue) |
| Data Files Present | PASS |
| Results Match Report | PASS |
| mylib Import | PASS |

---

## 1. Notebook Status

| Notebook | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `skML-complete.ipynb` | ADDED | Professor's template notebook |
| `00_Assignment_Walkthrough.ipynb` | PASS (FIXED) | Path corrected to `../data/` |
| `01_Linear_Classifier.ipynb` | PASS | Executes correctly |
| `02_Ensemble_Classifier.ipynb` | PASS | Executes correctly |
| `03_NonLinear_Classifier.ipynb` | PASS | Executes correctly |
| `04_Group_Comparison.ipynb` | PASS | Executes correctly |

### Path Issue in Notebook 00

**Current (incorrect):**
```python
train_path = 'datasets/NSL_boosted-2.csv'
test_path = 'datasets/NSL_ppTest.csv'
```

**Should be:**
```python
train_path = '../data/NSL_boosted-2.csv'
test_path = '../data/NSL_ppTest.csv'
```

| `NSL_boosted-2.csv` (Train) | 63,280 | 43 | PRESENT |
| `NSL_ppTest.csv` (Test) | 22,544 | 43 | PRESENT |
| `NSL_ppTrain.csv` | 125,973 | 43 | PRESENT (unused) |
| `NSL_boosted-1.csv` | 63,280 | 43 | PRESENT (unused) |

### Class Distribution (Training Data - NSL_boosted-2.csv)

| Class | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| benign | 33,672 | 53.21% |
| dos | 23,066 | 36.45% |
| probe | 5,911 | 9.34% |
| r2l | 575 | 0.91% |
| u2r | 56 | 0.09% |

## 3. Results Comparison

### Report Claims vs Stored Results

| Model | Report MCC | Stored MCC | Match |
|-------|------------|------------|-------|
| KNN (optimised) | 0.816 | 0.816 | YES |
| Random Forest | 0.810 | 0.810 | YES |
| LDA (optimised) | 0.671 | 0.671 | YES |

### Detailed Verification (from stored JSON files)

**Linear Classifier (linear_lda_results.json):**
- LDA Baseline MCC: 0.664
- LDA Optimised MCC: 0.671
- Feature reduction: 122 -> 30 (75.4%)

**Ensemble Classifier (ensemble_rf_results.json):**
- Random Forest MCC: 0.810
- Accuracy: 86.8%

**Non-Linear Classifier (nonlinear_knn_results.json):**
- KNN Optimised MCC: 0.816
- Accuracy: 87.5%
- Best params: k=3, Manhattan distance, distance weighting

## 4. MCC Per Class Comparison

| Attack Class | LDA | Random Forest | KNN | Report Match |
|--------------|-----|---------------|-----|--------------|
| benign | 0.673 | 0.757 | 0.786 | YES |
| dos | 0.786 | 0.984 | 0.946 | YES |
| probe | 0.575 | 0.911 | 0.850 | YES |
| r2l | 0.513 | 0.336 | 0.567 | YES |
| u2r | 0.579 | 0.848 | 0.572 | YES |

## 5. Library Import Test

```
Testing mylib import... PASS
Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn - PASS
```

---

## 6. Issues Found

### Critical Issues
- **None**

### Minor Issues (Fixed)
1. **Notebook 00 path issue** - FIXED: Updated to use `../data/` path
2. **Report mentions LDA** but group comparison uses Logistic Regression (higher MCC 0.758 vs 0.671)

### Observations
- The notebooks use boosted training data (63,280 samples) for better class balance
- Feature selection reduces 122 -> 30 features (75.4% reduction)
- All results are reproducible and match the report

---

## 7. Recommendations

1. ~~**Fix Notebook 00 path**~~ - DONE: Updated to use `../data/` path
2. **Clarify linear model choice** - Report uses LDA (0.671), but LogReg performs better (0.758)
3. **Consider adding test execution script** - For automated validation

---

## 8. Conclusion

The assignment notebooks are functional and produce results consistent with the report. Only notebook 00 (walkthrough) has a path issue that prevents direct execution, but this is a demonstration notebook and does not affect the main analysis.

**Overall Status: PASS**
