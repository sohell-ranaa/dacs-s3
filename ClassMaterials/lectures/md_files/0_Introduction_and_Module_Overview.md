## Slide 4: Outcomes Based Education

OBE is education based on producing particular educational outcomes that:

- Focus on what students can actually do after they are taught.
- Expect all learners / students to successfully achieve particular (sometimes minimum) level of knowledge and abilities.
It’s NOT what We want to teach.

It’s WHAT You should learn.

## Slide 5: Aims of this Module

This module will familiarise students with models and algorithms for machine learning, reinforcing the thesis of injecting data analytics into security operations to efficiently uncover patterns and identify indicators of compromise.

The theory and principles will be presented with a focus on practical experience with using industry standard frameworks for implementation and using data visualization techniques and strategies to communicate information.

This will prepare them to critically assess and evaluate business problems using pattern discovery and predictive modelling in research or industry applications.
